## About Me

Hi! I am an undergraduate researcher at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, working with Prof. Yonglu Li and supervised by Prof. Cewu Lu. I am also guided by Prof. Jianping He, Prof. Hong Li, and Dr. Junyi Zhang. My research interests lie in Embodied AI, robot learning, and Human-Robot Interaction. I am particularly interested in building intelligent systems that understand human behavior, learn from demonstrations, and collaborate adaptively in complex environments.
